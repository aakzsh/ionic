![Inspiration Image](insert_link_to_image_here)

Science has always been a collaborative endeavor, where ideas are born through shared curiosity and experimentation. The inspiration behind "Ionic" is to bring the thrill of scientific discovery to the digital realm, fostering collaboration and enabling users to perform experiments together, regardless of physical distance. 🌍🔍
Ably provides really cool methods to bring collaborative experiences and realtime data, which urged us to utilise the features and create ionic!

## What It Does 🚀

"Ionic" is a groundbreaking app that utilizes the power of the Ably SDKs to allow users to perform real-time, synchronized science experiments. From conducting chemistry experiments to exploring physics phenomena, users can seamlessly collaborate with their peers in a virtual lab environment. "Ionic" empowers scientists, educators, and students to connect, experiment, and learn together like never before. 📊👩‍🔬
The app is focused for growing kids at this moment, with the experiments being of beginner level. 

We wanted to check out if creating a learning experience like this would be possible, and we're happy that the end results look pretty good! The budding students can join the rooms and then start doing the practicals. They'll be able to read through the documentation to understand the aim of the experiment, and also how to achieve it. Different experiments utilises different features of Ably, based on the context of that specific experiment. The students can also chat with each other and discuss upon the requirements of the experiment and their learning bits. This gamifed version of learning is definitely a boost for kids to learn better and in a much enjoyable manner!

## How We Built It 🛠️

![Development Workflow Flowchart](insert_link_to_flowchart_here)

**"Ionic" was meticulously crafted using the following technologies:**
- **Ionic Framework**: For the user-friendly interface.
- **Ably API**: To create real-time, synchronized experiments.
- **React.js**: For dynamic user interactions.
- **Firebase**: For secure user authentication and data storage.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: For a seamless and responsive user experience.

Our development process was a harmonious blend of creativity, innovation, and teamwork. The real-time aspect was achieved by leveraging the Ably API's socket wrapper, enabling users to witness each other's experiments in real time. 💡👨‍💻

## Challenges We Ran Into ⚔️

Overcoming challenges is part of any journey. And surely, we also faced a bunch of challenges throughout the development of our application. Some of them includes:
- **Integrating multiple features together**: At some points, we wanted to include both locking feature and the live cursor feature into our application. So, we spent quite a while to figure it out and see if it's achievable.
- **Cross-device compatibility**: Making "Ionic" accessible on various devices was a constant challenge.
- **Data security**: Safeguarding user data was a top priority.

Through collaboration and perseverance, we conquered these challenges and emerged stronger. 🏆💪

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 🎉

We're thrilled to have achieved several remarkable goals with "Ionic":
- **First time creating such an app**: This is the first time we've created any application that involves socket connections and realtime collaborations, so thanks to Ably for that! And quite obviously, this was our first time using Ably SDKs as well. The wrappers on top of web sockets have been really helpful in bringing the app to work.
- **Increased scientific collaboration**: Ionic has the capability to bring together educators and students and let them collaborate and learn in a fun environment.
- **Utilisation and expansion of resources**: We're also proud that we were able to utilise a lot of resources provided by Ably, and the way they all are now essential parts of Ionic. We're also happy that Ionic has a vast range of features which makes it fun and more usable.
- **Custom made hook for locking**: So, while we were trying to integrate the feature of locking for the experiments input fields, we were faced with some errors that was not letting us transmit the edited value through the channel. So we ended up creating that hook's replacement ourselves, and now it also shows if any element is pre-locked while you've just joined the room. We think it's a pretty cool accomplishment as well!

These accomplishments drive us to continue improving and expanding the app's capabilities. 🌍📈
