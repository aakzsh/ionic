## Ionic: Igniting Collaborative Science Experiments üß™üî¨

Live app: https://ionic-lab.netlify.app/

Science has always been a collaborative endeavor, where ideas are born through shared curiosity and experimentation. The inspiration behind Ionic is to bring the thrill of scientific discovery to the digital realm, fostering collaboration and enabling users to perform experiments together, regardless of physical distance. üåçüîç Ably provides really cool methods to bring collaborative experiences and realtime data, which urged us to utilise the features and create ionic!
